About the Problem: Mental Health issue has become a cause for concern nowadays.Depression,Anxieties and many more mentall illness are just increasing just like the fire in a forest on summer days. The pandemic has even worsened the situation.Men,Women and even young children are coming in grasp of it.
Problem Nowadays: Mental health discussion has always been considered as a taboo. People suffering from mental health issues often refuse to contact counsellors and even doctors as they think what will the society think if they see them contacting and getting treated for their mental health issues. This needs to change.Depression leading to suicides is creating a havoc nowadays.According to WHO women and young children are affected drastically.
Solution:The only solution to all kinds of mental health issues is proper counselling.As we know sharing our problems with our close or loved ones and good advice from them will help to heal faster but in this fast changing world it is not possible . So basically we can make a Blog website where a person will login and share his/her problems and some qualified counsellors will be giving advices to them .This will give inspiration to other people to share their problems and get advice from the counsellors. Basically this blog website will charge a simple amount of money to the persons coming here to get advice. This money will go to the respective counsellor which in turn will aid them finacially and in turn of all of this the person who is scared to go out to meet the counsellor can contact them at the comfort of their houses and get treated properly.
